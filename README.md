# IT Assistant

IT Assistant is a simple Python application designed to be used in an IT support or help desk environment.  The app can be easily compiled into a Windows executable and installed on customer PCs.  The app makes it easy for end users to provide helpful information to an IT support technician such as the current username, host IP address and network connectivity check.  There's also a link to allows users to open a help ticket.  

There's a lot of room to improve this application, but the basic functionality is there.  To date, the largest confirmed IT environment that IT Assistant has supported had a device count of just over 250 machines/users.  Who knows where it could go with continued development? 

Feel free to fork the code and add any enhancements that you feel would make this application more useful.  :)
